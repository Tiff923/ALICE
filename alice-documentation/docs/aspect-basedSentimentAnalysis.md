# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)

- Sentiment Analysis focuses on classifying the overall sentiment of a document into positive or negative. On the other hand, aspect-based sentiment analysis allows us to understand the specific sentiment towards an aspect (in our case an entity). 
- The model includes a bert encoder, 2 attention network and a softmax output layer. The model learns the representation of an aspect and its context within a sentence with two attention network interactively. This gives rise to an accurate representation of the sentence and a precise classification subsequently. 
- The model is trained on restaurant reviews.

Assuming the output absaChapterCombinedS as seen above is generated from Chapter1.pdf, we would label 'Chapter1' as a chapter with negative sentiments with regards to Malaysia and positive sentiments with regards to Media Prima. The  sentiment towards each entity at the (entire) document level is determined by the sentiment expressed by most chapters. 


The output of `def absa_document_combined_c(dc, inc, filename):` is in the form: 

```python

'Malaysia': { 
			'sentiment': 'Negative',
