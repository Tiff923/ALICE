data = ["Hong Kong's legislature is moving forward on a controversial bill that would criminalise \"abuse\" of China's national anthem. A second reading of the bill is being held in the legislature on Wednesday, with protests expected. Security has been tightened in the area around the Legislative Council building with riot police deployed and barricades erected.\u00a0 If passed into law by the legislature,\u00a0Hong Kong's National Anthem Bill will govern the use and playing of the Chinese national anthem. This includes provisions that threaten to punish those who \"insult\" the anthem with up to three years jail and/or fines of up to HK$50,000 ($6,450). The bill states that \"all individuals and organisations\" should respect and dignify the national anthem and play it and sing it on \"appropriate occasions\". It also orders that primary and secondary school students be taught to sing the anthem, along with its history and etiquette.\u00a0 Anti-government protests last year were primarily aimed at resisting further integration with mainland China. The Chinese national anthem has been booed at several events, including football matches. Protesters and pro-democracy politicians say the bill represents the latest sign of what they see as accelerating interference from Beijing in the former British colony. Britain handed Hong Kong back to Chinese rule in 1997 with guarantees that the city's core freedoms and way of life would be protected under a \"one country, two systems\" formula, which Beijing says it respects. Freedoms of speech, press, association and assembly are explicitly written into the Basic Law, the mini-constitution that guides Hong Kong's relationship with the central government in Beijing - freedoms that opponents of the bill now say are under threat. More technically, some senior lawyers fear the bill is highly unusual in that it, in part, reflects the ideological aspirations of China's Communist Party. That could make it difficult to enforce. \"It is the first Hong Kong law I've seen that looks like it was written in Beijing,\" one senior judge told Reuters, speaking privately. \"It will be a nightmare to rule on.\" The Hong Kong Bar Association has acknowledged the need for such laws but said parts of the bill \"deviate from the good traditions\" of Hong Kong's common law system. It said there was a fundamental difference between that system and the \"socialist legal system of mainland China which would include political ideology and conceptual guidance\". For years, Chinese officials and their pro-Beijing allies in Hong Kong have wanted to instil a greater sense of Chinese patriotic pride across the city. Hong Kong's government says the bill reflects the city's own legal system and situation. \"The main spirit of the \u2026 bill is 'respect', which bears absolutely no relations to 'restricting freedom of speech' as claimed by certain members of the community and definitely not a so-called 'evil law',\" a spokesman said earlier this year. Further protests and intense legislative infighting over the bill are widely expected. The government, under pressure from Beijing, says it is now a priority to pass\u00a0the bill\u00a0into law before the end of this four-year legislative term in July. Having been mired in a log-jam of legislative procedural battles, the bill could face a third reading after Wednesday's proceedings, and possibly a vote early next month. If it misses the deadline, the government would then have to decide whether to re-introduce the bill in the next session or force it into law by promulgation, seen as a highly unusual and potentially explosive option. Deeper public consultation and a redraft would be the alternative. Longer-term, if the bill becomes law and is enforced, constitutional challenges can be expected in courts - both into the bill's content and the procedural battles through which it passed.",
        "Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, is just hours away from becoming the first-ever commercial entity to launch humans into orbit and then take them to the International Space Station (ISS). \"We're continuing to tick off our pre-flight readiness checklist,\" said Kathryn Lueders, program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, at a news conference on Monday. \"All the teams are 'go'.\" \"And we're continuing to make progress towards our mission. And now, the only thing we need to do is figure out how to control the weather,\" Lueders said. If successful, when the Demo-2 mission blasts off from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 20:33 GMT on Wednesday, it will launch the United States into a new, commercial era of spaceflight. Demo-2 will also crack open the human spaceflight domain that has been the sole preserve of rival Boeing Co, the storied aerospace giant. On Monday, forecasters from the US Space Force's 45th Space Wing concluded that there was a 60-percent chance that the SpaceX Crew Dragon launch would blast off on time, if thunderstorms cleared and the wind died down. \"It's really a dynamic situation that's developing across Florida,\" said Mike McAleenan, the space wing's launch weather officer, at the same news conference. \"We have some hope for launch day.\" In spite of the tricky weather outlook, NASA and SpaceX on Monday wrapped the final readiness review before Wednesday's scheduled test launch of two astronauts. The Demo-2 mission is the final major test before NASA certifies the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft for regular human transport missions to the ISS. Boeing, SpaceX's direct competitor in NASA's Commercial Crew Program, has suffered a series of failures that have held the company back from keeping pace. More than two\u00a0years\u00a0behind schedule, SpaceX is nevertheless delivering the Crew Dragon spacecraft and launch system for roughly $2.6bn, while Boeing has taken in some $4.2bn for its troubled Starliner effort. Last November, US Vice President Mike Pence told the two companies they had until this spring to launch astronauts into orbit. In December, bad software coding caused the Boeing Starliner capsule to fail to reach the correct orbit, forcing the company to forego a key test and contractual milestone - a rendezvous and docking with the ISS. Just before returning the capsule to Earth, Boeing personnel discovered more bad code which, if it had gone undetected, may have caused the loss of the spacecraft. Less than a month later, in January, SpaceX blew up one of its own rockets to prove, in an uncrewed \"in-flight abort\" test, that the Crew Dragon system can detect a fatal in-flight event and whisk astronauts away from danger. That milestone paved the way to this Wednesday's launch, which could upset Boeing's presumed spaceflight supremacy. That same month, Boeing told investors in a fourth-quarter earnings call that the company was taking a $410m pre-tax charge to find and fix the Starliner issues and perform another uncrewed test. The 15-year journey that has brought SpaceX to this historic juncture started as an idea and $500m in taxpayer money to incentivise the private sector into developing a commercially viable cargo launch service to the International Space Station. In 2005, then-NASA Administrator Mike Griffin's vision was that once companies had mastered cargo flights to the ISS, they should go on to develop the capability to launch humans. What was unforeseen at the time was that in six years NASA would cease using the Space Shuttle. With no human-rated US-made spacecraft in the pipeline, NASA had to rely on the only other space agency capable of sending humans into space - Russia's Roscosmos. As it was a sole-source market, it cost NASA a cool $85.4m per seat on a Soyuz rocket. Since 2017, the year Commercial Crew should have launched, NASA has shelled out more than $1bn to send US astronauts to the ISS, according to a NASA inspector general report. Even before the coronavirus took a bite out of the US economy and therefore the government's budget, NASA repeatedly said it needed \"reliable and cost-effective access to and from the International Space Station\". The estimated price for a Crew Dragon seat is roughly $55m, while a seat on Starliner is thought to be about $90m. Hans Koenigsmann, vice president, for SpaceX's Build and Flight Reliability division, said: \"We spent many years in development. An incredible amount of testing.\" He added, \"There was a lot of urgent and important work done over the last couple of months, the years ... There are no show-stoppers. Everything is looking good.\" In the beginning, Sierra Nevada Company and Blue Origin, in addition to Boeing and SpaceX, attempted to provide cargo services. In 2014, only SpaceX and Boeing made the final cut to develop spacecraft and launch systems for the Commercial Crew Program. Wednesday's launch will be only the fifth time that NASA astronauts have launched in a new US-made vehicle. Crew Dragon, sitting atop the 23-story-tall Falcon-9 rocket, will join the ranks of Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle, that is if all goes according to plan. \"I would say it's something maybe we dreamed about, flying something other than a Shuttle, the next vehicle. It did not seem likely at the time when we arrived in the astronaut office,\" said NASA astronaut Bob Behnken on Friday in his last news conference before the Demo-2 launch. \"We've longed to be part of a test mission, a test space flight,\" he said. It has been just under nine years since astronauts landed the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center, completing mission STS-135, and ending that vehicle programme's 30 years of service. Now Behnken and fellow astronaut Doug Hurley, who have been in quarantine for more than three weeks, are spending their last day and hours before launch taking in technical briefings, having medical checks and spending time with their families. After launch, weather permitting, it will take 19 hours for the Crew Dragon to reach the ISS. Once Hurley and Behnken reach the ISS, they are expected to stay there anywhere from six weeks to three months before returning.",
        "The trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption charges has opened in Jerusalem, days after he began a new term in office. Mr Netanyahu, 70, is the first standing leader to face trial in the country's history. He denies accusations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Arrived at the courthouse for a brief hearing, he said the cases were aimed at \"toppling him in any way possible\".  He was sworn back into office as head of a rare unity government a week ago. His political rival, Benny Gantz, agreed to share power following three inconclusive elections in under a year. He has rejected calls by opponents to step down while he fights the cases. The leader of the right-wing Likud party is Israel's longest-serving prime minister, having been in power continuously since 2009. He also served a term in office from 1996-1999. What happened at the court? As he arrived at the Jerusalem District Court on Sunday, he told reporters: \"I'm here with a straight back and my head held high.\"  \"When you need to take me down, a strong prime minister from the right, everything is possible,\" he added. At the start of the hearing, which lasted about an hour, Mr Netanyahu told the judges: \"I read and I understand the indictment.\"  He stood in a face mask and refused to sit down on the defendants' bench until the reporters left the room, local media say. His lawyers say they need several months to prepare their defence. The date for the next hearing has been set for 19 July. Mr Netanyahu has been indicted in three cases, known as 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000: Mr Netanyahu has strongly denied all the charges against him, branding them a \"witch-hunt\" by political opponents, and has vowed to clear his name.  According to Israeli law, a leader charged with a crime is not required to resign. But there is no precedent. A former prime minister, Ehud Olmert, stepped down as party leader when he was under investigation for corruption in 2008 but technically remained prime minister until elections the following year - polls which brought Benjamin Netanyahu to power. Under the power-sharing deal with Benny Gantz, a new role of \"alternate prime minister\" was created, which means when the two men switch positions in 18 months' time, Mr Netanyahu will still occupy a prime ministerial office and stay on as Mr Gantz's deputy. In short, a serving prime minister occupying the most powerful office in the land simultaneously trying to clear his name and avoid jail-time. Opposition leader Yair Lapid called it \"an embarrassment\" and \"horrible for the spirit of the nation\" though it is not expected to affect government policy. Mr Netanyahu is still likely to press ahead with plans to annex Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley - territory in the occupied West Bank - in the coming months, a move certain to infuriate the Palestinians. Opinion in Israel as to whether he should carry on as prime minister is split: critics say the spectacle of a trial makes Mr Netanyahu's job untenable, but his supporters - including his party - say he has been democratically elected and should not be forced out. Even if he is convicted, Mr Netanyahu will not be required to resign unless and until any appeals are exhausted - which could, in theory, be many months or years into the future. In Ehud Olmert's case, the former prime minister went on trial in 2009 and after he was convicted only began serving his sentence in 2016 due to the long legal process.",
        "Malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which US President Donald Trump says he has been taking, is tied to increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients, according to a study published in medical journal The Lancet on Friday. The study, which observed more than 96,000 people hospitalised with COVID-19, showed that people treated with the drug, or the closely related drug chloroquine, had a higher risk of death when compared with those who had not been given the medicine. Demand for hydroxychloroquine, a drug approved decades ago, surged after Trump touted its use as a coronavirus treatment in early April. Earlier this week, he surprised the world by admitting he was taking the pill as preventive medicine. The Lancet study authors suggested these treatment regimens should not be used for COVID-19 outside of clinical trials until results from clinical trials are available to confirm the safety and efficacy of the medications for COVID-19 patients. The authors said they could not confirm if taking the drug resulted in any benefit in coronavirus patients. The study was based on a retrospective analysis of medical records. It looked at data from 671 hospitals, where 14,888 patients were given either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, with or without the antibiotic macrolide, and 81,144 patients were not on any of the treatment regimens. A similar analysis in the US found similar results. That study, funded in part by the US government's National Institutes of Health, found higher overall mortality in coronavirus patients who took hydroxychloroquine while in Veterans Administration hospitals. It found no benefit and more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquine versus standard care alone. The work was posted online for researchers and has not been reviewed by other scientists. Trump, without evidence, called the veterans study a \"Trump enemy statement\". \"If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old, almost dead,\" Trump told reporters Tuesday. Weeks ago, Trump had promoted hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment based on a positive report about its use against the virus, but subsequent studies found that it was not helpful and came with risks. The US Food and Drug Administration in April issued a warning about its use.\u00a0", 
        "A slowdown in China's economy this year should allow Mexico to attract more investment, lure companies and create jobs, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday. Speaking at a regular government news conference, Lopez Obrador pointed to forecasters' expectations that China's economy will post its weakest growth in years in 2020 amid disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak. \"That means this big factory, the biggest factory in the world, will reduce its output,\" he said, referring to China. \"And this gives us the opportunity, Mexico, for more investment to arrive, for companies to set up, for jobs to be created.\" Lopez Obrador noted that the sealing of the new North American trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), would help spur business with the US. Mexican business leaders hope the USMCA, which goes into effect on July 1, as well as continuing tensions between the US and China, will spur more investment inside the North American region, benefitting Mexico.",
        "LONDON \u2014 A jury in Britain on Tuesday convicted the brother of a suicide bomber who killed 22 people at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester in 2017, finding him guilty on all 22 counts of murder for his role in planning and executing the attack. The man, Hashem Abedi, was the brother of Salman Abedi, the man who detonated a vest laden with explosives, killing children, teenagers, and parents waiting to pick them up after Ms. Grande\u2019s concert at Manchester Arena in northwestern England. More than 235 people were injured in the bombing, one of Britain\u2019s worst recent terrorist attacks, and hundreds of others suffered psychological damage. The jury took four and a half hours to find Hashem Abedi guilty on all of the murder charges, along with one count of attempted murder and one count of conspiracy to cause an explosion. A murder conviction carries an automatic life sentence, prosecutors said. \u201cHashem Abedi encouraged and helped his brother knowing that Salman Abedi planned to commit an atrocity,\u201d Max Hill, director of public prosecutions, said in a statement. \u201cHe has blood on his hands even if he didn\u2019t detonate the bomb.\u201d Mr. Hill said he hoped Mr. Abedi\u2019s conviction would give the victims\u2019 families \u201ca sense that some justice has been done.\u201d Mr. Abedi had pleaded not guilty to all 24 counts, but he offered no evidence or testimony during six weeks of proceedings, stopped participating in the trial and, ultimately, stopped attending. The brothers used three addresses in Manchester to prepare for the attack, the Manchester police said: one as a delivery address for the chemicals, a second to manufacture the explosives and a third to build the final version of the bomb. Hashem Abedi, 22, was born in Britain to Libyan parents. He was extradited from Libya to Britain in July. Mr. Abedi and his older brother had left Britain for Libya about a month before the May 22, 2017, attack. Salman Abedi, three years older than his brother Hashem, flew back to Britain four days before the Manchester attack. Although Hashem Abedi remained in Libya at the time of the attack, he knew of his brother\u2019s plans and helped him carry them out, prosecutors told the jury. Jurors also heard that Hashem Abedi had used some household items to make early prototypes of the bomb, and that the brothers had bought a car, which they then used to store bomb-making equipment, two days before flying to Libya. Soon after the attack, the Islamic State claimed responsibility. Intelligence officials said later that Salman Abedi, while in Libya, had met with members of an Islamic State unit linked to the 2015 Paris terrorist attack. \u201cSalman Abedi exploded the bomb which caused this devastation, but people now know that this horrific attack was planned with his brother, Hashem Abedi,\u201d Russ Jackson, assistant chief constable of the Manchester police, said in a statement, adding that Mr. Abedi was \u201cevery bit as guilty\u201d as his brother. \u201cHe was his brother\u2019s driver, the quartermaster sourcing deadly material and the munitions technician in those months running up to the attack,\u201d he added. Figen Murray, the mother of Martyn Hett, a young public relations manager from Stockport who died in the attack, said that though the verdict brought her \u201ccomfort to know the British justice system has played its role,\u201d it did not give her closure, the BBC reported on Tuesday. Still, the victim\u2019s father, Paul Hett, said that the guilty verdict offered \u201can overwhelming sense of justice,\u201d according to the BBC."]

data  = ["World Health Organization (WHO) member states have agreed to set up an independent inquiry into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic.  The resolution, approved without objection by the WHO's 194-member annual assembly meeting virtually in Geneva, also allows for the inquiry to look into the health body's own role.  The United States in particular has been highly critical of its response.  The EU presented the resolution on behalf of 100 nations. It calls for an \"impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation\" of the international response. This will also focus on the WHO's \"timelines pertaining to the Covid-19 pandemic\". The body has faced criticism that it was late to declare a health emergency. The resolution also calls for the world to ensure \"transparent, equitable and timely access\" to any treatments or vaccines, and pushes for the WHO to investigate the \"source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population\".  \"As I see no requests for the floor, I take it that there is no objection and the resolution is therefore adopted,\" declared the assembly's president, Keva Bain, the Bahamas ambassador.  President Donald Trump has labelled the organisation a \"puppet\" of China and suspended funding for the WHO. The US is the largest donor.  He has also accused China of trying to cover up the outbreak - something it strongly rejects - and said the WHO had failed to hold Beijing to account. The president on Monday published a letter he sent to WHO head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus outlining specific issues the US has.  US Health Secretary Alex Azar was scathing in his address to the assembly on Monday.  \"We must be frank about one of the primary reasons this outbreak spun out of control: there was a failure by this organisation to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives,\" he said.  President Trump faces re-election this year and opponents see his criticism as an attempt to deflect blame for his handling of the pandemic in the US, which has the highest number of cases, and deaths, which passed 90,000 on Monday.  However, the European Union, along with countries including the UK, Australia and New Zealand, had also been pushing for an inquiry into how the pandemic was handled.  EU spokeswoman Virginie Battu-Henriksson said that several key questions needed to be answered as part of any review. \"How did this pandemic spread? What is the epidemiology behind it? All this is absolutely crucial for us going forward to avoid another pandemic of this kind,\" she said. But she added that now was not the time for \"any sort of blame game\".  Dr Tedros had already agreed to a review of the agency's handling of the pandemic, while dismissing suggestions it needed a far-reaching overhaul. He said an independent evaluation, which would look at what lessons could be learned and put forward any recommendations, would take place \"at the earliest opportunity\". He called for the WHO, among other organisations, to be strengthened. The first coronavirus cases emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last December. The virus was widely reported to have sprung from a food market after crossing the species barrier from animals to humans. China was accused of trying to cover up the infections in the early weeks.   Some senior US politicians have suggested that the source was a laboratory in Wuhan that had been carrying out research on bat coronaviruses. China has dismissed the idea, and Western experts have cast doubt too. China says it has been frank about the development of the epidemic in China, publishing the genetic code of the virus in January and being quick to share information with the WHO.  President Xi Jinping told the assembly on Monday that his country had acted \"with openness and transparency\" and insisted that any investigation should happen after the pandemic was brought under control.  Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday that the US was trying to smear China in order to avoid its own responsibilities. More than 4.5 million people have been infected globally and more than 300,000 have died since the virus first emerged. ", 
         "Chile's government has said it will go ahead with a controversial plan to issue certificates to people who have recovered from Covid-19. The documents would be given to people to allow them to return to work, Deputy Health Minister Paula Daza said. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said there is \"no evidence\" that people who contract coronavirus are immune from being infected again. It said certificates could inspire false confidence and help it spread. Chile has reported 189 virus-related deaths and more than 13,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. \"There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,\" the WHO said in a briefing note on Friday. The body argued that so-called \"immunity certificates\" could even be harmful, because they could lead people to ignore public health advice and therefore increase the risk of transmitting the disease. But Ms Daza told reporters on Sunday: \"One of the things that we know is that a person who has had the illness has a lower probability of becoming ill again.\" She added that the certificates would not confirm that people had immunity to Covid-19, but rather state that they had recovered from the disease and had completed a period of isolation. At least 200,000 people have died with the coronavirus across the world, and many governments are now trying to find ways to ease their lockdown restrictions.", 
         "A Kenyan nurse found herself being shunned and harassed after she prepared a patient for a Covid-19 test while she was on a nightshift.  Eunice Mwabili says the case was handled professionally - she wore personal protective equipment while dealing with the man, who was placed in an isolation room at the hospital. By the next morning, her friends and neighbours in the capital, Nairobi, had begun to avoid her, fearing she had become infected with coronavirus. It is unclear who leaked the information that she had organised to have the patient tested - but both her name and number were leaked on social media. The patient ended up being negative, but that news never filtered out - the damage was done. She began to receive phone calls from strangers - some wanting to know where she worked - and anxious friends wanting to find out her status.  \"Out there it was like I was already a Covid suspect. It really affected me. The story was even on the media. It was on TV,\" Ms Mwabili told the BBC. One neighbour shouted to her: \"I hear you are the one catching coronavirus patients.\" An acquaintance told her husband that she really pitied him \"because of what has happened to your wife\". \"Do you imagine, up to today that lady friend has never bothered to call me to find out how I'm doing after that incident,\" she said. She is not the only Kenyan who has faced coronavirus-linked stigma. Even some of those who have recovered have found it hard to be accepted back into their communities. Recently Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe spoke about someone who had fully recovered but was not allowed to re-join their local choir. The ministry says others have found that after leaving hospital even their families have been stigmatised. And the fear is pervasive. One man I contacted to find out about life in a quarantine centre refused to answer my questions as he feared the stigma he would be subjected to afterwards. He had been sent to the facility as a precautionary measure for 14 days after some people in the apartment block in which he lived tested positive for coronavirus - though he never contracted the virus. Even before the country registered its first coronavirus infection, an MP's xenophobic Facebook message went viral in February as he called for his constituents to avoid nationals from China, where the virus originated.  In April, Brenda Cherotich, among the first coronavirus patients to recover, was interviewed on television about her experiences. Officials wanted her to be the beacon of hope, to show that people could survive the illness - instead she was subjected to cyberbullying. Not long after that, a 27-year-old man in the coastal city of Mombasa was \"condemned to death by medics\" who abandoned him in his hour of need fearing he had Covid-19, his father told The People Daily newspaper. For the nurse, Ms Mwabili, it all started when Davis Muturi walked into private Catholic Church-run hospital where she worked at the end of March. The 40-year-old chef had returned from the US a week before. He had gone into self-isolation on his return, asking his family to move in with relatives as a precaution. \"I had a one-month-old baby who I had never seen, and my wife was shocked and worried that I was sending the family away and did not want to see them. But after explaining, she understood that it was for the good of the family,\" he told the BBC. After seven days, he went to the hospital for a test because he was scared by reports on social media about the virus - and he wanted to be sure he didn't have it. \"The way they put it is like everyone who came into the country was already affected,\" he said. But after he did the test his name and phone number were also leaked - with people alleging online that he had coronavirus. Even though he had tested negative, he was afraid of leaving his house - scared he would be accused of deliberately trying to infect other people. He contacted Ms Mwabili to see if she knew how their information had been shared: \"She told me that her colleagues were even asking her why she was not isolating herself. But I was not even positive.\" Ms Mwabili can only point to a visit by the police on the evening of Mr Muturi's check-up. The officers had wanted information about suspected Covid-19 patients as part of an ongoing investigation into an escape from a coronavirus quarantine centre. It seems a police memo about their visit was leaked.  \"I don't know exactly how it leaked with my name and details, as well as that of my client,\" she said.  The hospital has complained about the leak, and police say the matter is under investigation.  Ms Mwabili says what made it more challenging was after the leak, she went down with tonsillitis for a week. \"When I resumed at work, some of my colleagues were asking, 'Did you go on quarantine?'... You can just suspect what was going through their minds.\" More than a month later, Ms Mwabili says she is a stronger person after going through the experience. It has made her more determined to do her job well as \"each person, whether positive or negative, needs our services\". For Mr Muturi, the moment he learnt that he was Covid-19-free, he could not wait to meet his new baby. \"That very day, they came back immediately, I couldn't let my family stay for another night away from me.\"",
         "Testing of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for coronavirus has been halted because of safety fears, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Trials in several countries are being \"temporarily\" suspended as a precaution, the agency said on Monday. It comes after a recent medical study suggested the drug could increase the risk of patients dying from Covid-19. President Donald Trump has said he has taken the drug to ward off the virus. The US president has repeatedly promoted the anti-malarial drug, against medical advice and despite warnings from public health officials that it could cause heart problems. Last week, a study in medical journal The Lancet said there were no benefits to treating coronavirus patients with hydroxychloroquine, and that taking it might even increase the number of deaths among those in hospital with the disease. Hydroxychloroquine is safe for malaria, and conditions like lupus or arthritis, but no clinical trials have recommended its use for treating Covid-19. The WHO, which is running clinical trials of various drugs to assess which might be beneficial in treating the disease, has previously raised concerns over reports of individuals self-medicating and causing themselves serious harm. On Monday, officials at the UN health agency said hydroxychloroquine would be removed from those trials pending a safety assessment.  The Lancet study involved 96,000 coronavirus patients, nearly 15,000 of whom were given hydroxychloroquine - or a related form chloroquine - either alone or with an antibiotic. The study found that the patients were more likely to die in hospital and develop heart rhythm complications than other Covid patients in a comparison group. The death rates of the treated groups were: hydroxychloroquine 18%; chloroquine 16.4%; control group 9%. Those treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in combination with antibiotics had an even higher death rate. The researchers warned that hydroxychloroquine should not be used outside of clinical trials.",
         "A former top US health official has told Congress the country could face its \"darkest winter in modern history\" because of the coronavirus. Rick Bright led the government agency trying to develop a vaccine, but was removed from his post last month. Mr Bright says he was ousted from the job after refusing to promote an untested drug treatment being touted as a \"game changer\" by President Trump. Mr Trump has claimed Mr Bright is a \"disgruntled\" employee. Mr Bright also told the House of Representatives subcommittee on health \"lives were lost\" because of government \"inaction\" in the early stages of the outbreak. He said he first spoke out about a medical equipment shortage in January, raising the issue to the \"highest levels\" of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but \"got no response\". In other US developments: During his testimony, Mr Bright warned that the US's \"window of opportunity\" to deal with the coronavirus was \"closing\". \"If we fail to improve our response now, based on science, I fear the pandemic will get worse and be prolonged,\" he said. \"Without better planning, 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history.\" Mr Bright also told the subcommittee that in January he received an email he would \"never forget\", from a supplier of medical-grade face masks who warned of a severe shortage. \"He said... we need to act. And I pushed that forward to the highest level that I could of HHS - and got no response.\" Mr Bright said his removal from his post was the result of his insisting that money allocated by Congress to deal with the virus should be put \"into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit\". \"I spoke out then, and I am testifying today, because science - not politics or cronyism - must lead the way to combat this deadly virus,\" he added. A whistleblower complaint, filed earlier this month, says Mr Bright was removed from his post as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (Barda) for political reasons. Mr Bright says he was ousted for refusing to push the drugs hydroxychloroquine and the related chloroquine as potential cures for Covid-19. President Trump had referred to hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, as a potential \"game-changer\" in the treatment of Covid-19 - despite many experts cautioning that it could be ineffective or even dangerous. Research conducted by the Veterans Health Administration in the US which has been submitted for expert review suggests the drug gave no benefits for those taking it, and could actually raise the risk of death for patients in US veterans hospitals.  Mr Bright's complaint alleges that he chose to speak to a journalist because government officials \"refused to listen\" to his warnings. He said he had an obligation to try and protect the public \"from drugs which he believed constituted a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety\". After the hearing, President Trump told reporters: \"I don't know him. I never met him. I don't want to meet him. \"But I watched him, and he looks like an angry, disgruntled employee who, frankly, according to some people, didn't do a very good job.\" Health secretary Alex Azar claimed officials had followed Mr Bright's recommendations. \"Everything he was complaining about was achieved - what he talked about was done,\" Mr Azar said. \"He said he talked about the need for respirators. We procured respirators at the president's direction. He said we need a Manhattan Project on a vaccine. We had a Manhattan Project.\"",
         "As many as 190,000 people across Africa could die in the first year of the coronavirus pandemic if crucial containment measures fail, the World Health Organization (WHO) warns. The new research also predicts a prolonged outbreak over a few years. \"It likely will smoulder in transmission hot spots,\" says WHO Africa head Matshidiso Moeti. This patchier and slower pattern of transmission sets Africa apart from other regions, WHO experts say. Other factors taken into account are the region's younger populations who have \"benefitted from the control of communicable diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis\", as well as lower mortality rates. The WHO's warning comes as Africa's most populous nation, Nigeria, plus others including South Africa and Ivory Coast, have begun relaxing some of their lockdown measures. The study finds that between 29 million and 44 million people in the WHO African region could get infected in the first year of the pandemic. Between 83,000 and 190,000 could die in the same period, it warns. The estimates are based on prediction modelling, and focus on 47 countries in the WHO African region with a combined population of one billion - Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, Eritrea, Sudan, Somalia and Djibouti are not included. Across the whole of the African continent more than 2,000 coronavirus deaths have been recorded by Africa's Centre for Disease Control. By comparison, 140,000 have died in Western Europe, where the virus took hold several weeks earlier. Cases have been recorded in every African nation except Lesotho. South Africa has the highest number of confirmed cases - more than 8,200 and 160 deaths - while Algeria has the most deaths - 483. \"Covd-19 could become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region,\" Dr Moeti says in a WHO statement.  \"We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.\""]
